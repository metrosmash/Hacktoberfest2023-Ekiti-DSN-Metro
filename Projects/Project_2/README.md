Analyze the data and build a machine learning model capable of diagnosing common diseaes among students. 
### Dataset Description
This project makes use of two datasets (Training and testing) both in the csv format.
One is for training the model while the other is for testing the model.


Each CSV file has 133 columns. 132 of these columns are symptoms that a person experiences and last column is the prognosis.
These symptoms are mapped to 42 diseases you can classify these set of symptoms to. this means that there are 42 prognosis 

You are required to train your model on the  training data and test it on testing data
### Reference
The data was gotten from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning)
